So, you've mastered Git. You work with it on a daily basis and operations like merging and/or rebasing is second nature to you. 
You feel comfortable using Git and people tend to come to you for Git related questions 

But now you've been asked to incorporate Git in a new project where a lot of people will be working together. This raises a lot of new questions:

- What should the scope of your Git repository be? 
- Mono repository or multiple small repositories?
- With multiple repositories how do we make system wide changes in a controlled matter? Are there alternatives?
- What will our branching strategy look like? Do we default to merging or rebasing?
- Branching strategies with a project that is still in development and a project that is in maintenance mode.

I will also provide some tricks of the trade such as:

- Recommended tooling for versioning
- Using the SHA within your deployments to uniquely identify them.

In short, this training is meant for you if you want to use Git on a higher level where you will be the one responsible for deciding how to configure it and use it for your project.
This is NOT a training if you've never used Git - for that I have another trainingðŸ™‚

This will be an extremely interactive session where I expect input and questions from each participant. Each situation is unique and we can all learn from it.
